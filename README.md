F3 (OpenERP) SDK
=================

This project collects all the scripts+utilities used during development
and packaging of OpenERP/F3[1].
None of these shall be needed in production servers. But, some scripts
could be useful in debugging even such a server.

[1] F3 is an open-sourced fork of OpenERP . Several of the scripts/techniques
in this project apply both to F3 and older OpenERP versions.
